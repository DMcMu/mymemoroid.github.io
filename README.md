**My Memoroid**

Everyone captures moments using their devices. Selfies, pictures, etc. Memories and experiences are stored on our devices. MyMemoroid is a solution to turn memories into something real, something physical. How? Polaroids. Turn your memories into Polaroids using our web service or kiosks located at popular attractions.

Alternate:

Everyone takes pictures with their phones. Whether it be notes, selfies, landscape or something more sentimental, it's a daily part of life. We put these pictures on instagram, snapchat; everywhere over social media. But for those special moments, the pictrues with a bit more sentimental value, with a bit more fun value, with a bit more fun value: we offer polaroids. My Memoroid can put those valuable moments into a physical form that you can put anywhere, and keep forever.
