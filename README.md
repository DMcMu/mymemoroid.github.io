**My Memoroid**

Everyone captures moments using their devices. Selfies, pictures, etc. Memories and experiences are stored on our devices. MyMemoroid is a solution to turn memories into something real, something physical. How? Polaroids. Turn your memories into Polaroids using our web service or kiosks located at popular attractions.
